Could we read the heart of every man and boy we pass upon the street,
how few--how very few--there are that would not reveal sickening
pictures of lust, disease, melancholy and insanity. Charnel-houses of
sin and lust--sloughs of despond and regret--excess of passion offset
by lack of power--dread, despair, hopelessness, shame and desperation,
making a picture of misery scarcely to be conceived by any but those
unfortunate beings who in the thoughtless, careless heyday of youth, or
the reckless reliance on more mature vigor, have weakened, emasculated
and enslaved themselves by indulgences and excesses that have borne
fruit of misery, disease and desperation in after years.

How little the youth who, in his ignorance of the terrible consequences
of his vice, steals away to the secrecy of his chamber or his bed,
leaving his happy, healthy and playful companions, in order that he
may let the hot waves of lust and passion run riot in his mind, and dry
up every spring of healthy thought and action--how little does he think
of the after-time of misery and exhaustion that he is bringing upon
himself--how little does he think that the vile demon that he is raising
up will, like the vampire, suck his very life-blood, steal away his
strength and life and vivacity, besmirch and weaken his mind, take the
strength from his muscles, the courage from his heart, sap the very
foundation of his existence, unsex and unnerve him, render him feeble,
wavering and imbecile, dog his footsteps to the very steps of the altar,
to curse and blacken and disappoint those joys of parentage and marital
right that should be his. The shadow deepens with him as life advances,
and follows him, bringing shame and misery and despair at every step,
until the poor victim, driven too far, sinks into an early grave by
disease or suicide, or is lost to the world and to all joys and friends
behind the doors of an insane asylum.

He died of no disease known to medical science. He simply faded
away--weaker, more nerveless and hopeless day by day; he faded away
until, almost before any one knew it, the grave yawned to receive him.
Poor, miserable, hopeless wreck--poor suicide, for his own sin and crime
were the real causes of his death.

How many such there are at the present day. We meet them on the street,
in business and at church. Our insane asylums are full of them. We
find their wives unfaithful or unhappy; and their offspring--when they
are cursed with any--poor, miserable, weak fledgelings, with aged,
wasted faces, water on the brain, with rickets and softening of the
bones--idiots or imbeciles--dying early and scarcely regretted even
by the parent whose progeny they are, for every wail of the little
suffering voice pierced his heart and reminded him of his lustful sin,
and passionate, inexcusable indulgence that caused all this misery.

  "And the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children,
  even to the third and fourth generations."

Alas, how true! how indisputable! The imperative Laws of Nature once
broken, the consequences are _inevitable_.

Of late years it has become the fashion amongst certain men to scoff
at this terrible vice of secret indulgence, and to claim that its
evil effects are overrated, are portrayed too vividly. Ask some poor
unfortunate whose confidence you may succeed in gaining, and listen to
the pitiful tale of lost health and vitality he will tell you. Mark well
the wasted hand, the putty-like skin, the black-ringed, lack-lustre
eyes, the heavy lip, the labored breath--read the consequences of his
sin and crime in his shame-faced way, his shambling gait, his nerveless
hands, his fluttering heart, his weakened muscles, and his tottering
memory and mind.

Must he needs lie dead at our feet before these skeptics can be
convinced? Is not such a state a living death? Must these men visit
him in the cell of the asylum, watch him as a raving maniac, gaze upon
him as a hopeless idiot or a driveling imbecile, before they will be
convinced? Such proof is at hand. Not an asylum in any country but has
its score of such; not an asylum record-book but chronicles the sad
histories of thousands of these poor, lost creatures--male and female;
not an asylum nurse or doctor but will sadly point out these creatures
to you, bereft of every trace of reason, all sense of shame, still
practicing the horrible vice that has driven every semblance of humanity
from their faces and the very light of reason from their eyes.

True, every boy or man who practices this vice does not come to this
end. But who shall discriminate? There are thousands such, and who shall
say which it shall be, or at what moment it shall occur? Ah! happy,
rosy-cheeked boy, so gay and thoughtless now, so free from misery,
disease and care, beware! It may be your turn next. A little thoughtless
indulgence, the imitation of friend or companion, though apparently
harmless now, may blanch your rosy cheek, destroy your peace and
happiness of mind, and make a life-long, hopeless, suffering invalid
of you--may shut the door of all earthly enjoyment in your face, blast
your hopes, disease or destroy your offspring, alienate you from friends
and family, and cut off from all communion with your race, make you an
object of shame and disgust to your fellow-men, sink you into an early
grave or entomb you for life in the cold stony walls of a lunatic
asylum.

The day will come, erstwhile, when you will curse the parents who reared
you, the friends who surrounded you and the teachers and ministers who
taught you, for not warning you of the terrible nature of this
indulgence, so secretly common amongst boys and young men.

The day will come, when in the midst of your mental, moral and physical
agony, with weakened mind and exhausted body, physicians will tell you
that masturbation is practically harmless, that its consequences are
exaggerated, and that your sufferings are mostly imaginary. Then will
you pity their ignorance and bemoan the fact that to such men must
sufferers in your terrible extremity apply without any feeling of being
understood, appreciated or sympathized with, and, far less, relieved or
cured.

Happy will you be then, if you can (with your vice and misery staring
you in the face and threatening you with some or all of its dire
consequences) direct your steps to those who not only can and will
sympathize with you, but who are able to aid you with proper remedies
and restoratives and set you safely on the way to health and happiness
again. For there _are_ proper aids and remedies; there are hope and
happiness to be obtained if the affections growing out of this vice
be skillfully taken in hand in time. None but the hopeless sufferers
who have been lifted from the misery, shame and weakness of their
self-inflicted suffering know how much this world owes to the high
medical skill, exhaustive study, and persistent search for truth and
proper remedies of those two great Frenchmen, +Professors Claude
Lallemand+ and +Jean Civiale+. The medical as well as civil honors
conferred upon them by their country and their medical brethren, great
as they were, could never half repay them for the good they rendered
thoughtless youth and suffering manhood by their special discoveries.
There can be no question but that the +Civiale Urethral Crayons+, named
thus after this great specialist, and endorsed by the most eminent
medical men of France (that country in which lust and passion are
peculiarly prevalent), are the most far-reaching and reliable specifics
for Generative, Sexual and Nervous diseases known.


CAUSES OF SPERMATORRHOEA AND IMPOTENCY.
  SELF-ABUSE NOT THE ONLY CAUSE.

Many years' experience in the treatment of these debilitating diseases
has proven very surely that there are many causes besides Self-Abuse
(Self-Pollution, Secret Vice or Masturbation) for Spermatorrhoea,
Impotency and Debility or Lost Manhood. Self-Abuse is the most common
cause, and we therefore give it the most prominence. The others we will
name briefly in about the order of their frequency.

1. MARRIAGE EXCESSES.--A very common cause, more often producing
Impotency (loss of Sexual Desire or Power) and Sterility (inability to
beget offspring), than Spermatorrhoea (loss of vital fluid, daily and
nightly losses, losses in the urine, nervous prostration, debility,
insanity, paralysis, &c. For full description of symptoms, see pages
12-16). Sexual desire was given to mankind, like any other power or
appetite--to be enjoyed in reasonable moderation _and for the purpose of
insuring a continuance of our species by the birth of offspring_. Many
men abuse this power--abuse it inordinately, shamefully--and suffer the
consequences. This is especially true of the newly married, and men
advanced in years, who push their failing powers too far. As a just
retribution for the abuse of so important a function, the Almighty
deprives some of desire, some of power, some of both.

2. ONANISM.--By many this is confused with Masturbation or Self-Abuse.
While like it in some respects and in many of its consequences, it is
still different. It is as hurtful to an adult as abuse is to a young
person. God punished Onan for this sin, hence its name. Yet, despite
this terrible example so plainly set forth in the Old Testament,
probably one-half of the married men of the present day are pursuing it,
and hence so many Impotent and Powerless persons, seeking vainly amongst
the many cheap, quack remedies for something to re-invigorate and
re-vitalize them.

This is a terrible vice, terrible in its consequences, and however hardy
and robust the man, sooner or later his sexual powers must and will
succumb to the strain. Many men write us, saying that they never
masturbated, and yet are totally impotent and cannot understand why
it is. And yet they have been thus injuring themselves for years!

Sexual power and desire were given us for one purpose--the perpetuation
of our species, and whoso endeavors to avoid this, must suffer. Many
married couples do not want more children, from care, poverty or other
causes, and hence the extent to which this terrible practice is
indulged. It _must_ be from ignorance, for were it commonly known how
injurious this practice is, _but few would dare take the terrible risk_.

And yet the resulting weakness can be speedily cured if properly
treated. In no class of cases have the Civiale Remedies achieved greater
success than in these.

3. ANYTHING DEBILITATING--such as Overwork, Confinement, Sedentary
Occupations, Worry, Care, Excitement, &c., &c.--These are much more
common causes of Sexual and Generative Diseases than is generally
supposed, and usually very obstinate and difficult to treat, because
the system is so run down that there is very little stamina or vitality
to rely upon. Clerks, business men, lawyers, bankers, ministers and
students are very subject to this form of impaired vital and sexual
power. Theological students are very prone to it. Many do not have any
idea as to what their real trouble is, and lose much valuable time in
doctoring for Dyspepsia, Consumption, Neurasthenia and the like, when
really their very life and vitality are oozing away from them in their
urine or otherwise.

4. WOMEN'S (OR VENEREAL) DISEASES.--Gonorrhoea (clap), Gleet, Stricture,
Injury to the Urine Canal from the rough use of sounds, bougies,
catheters, &c., &c. Any one or all of these, by extending the
inflammation backward to the seminal ducts and neck of the bladder,
may cause either Spermatorrhoea or Impotency. Indeed, Stricture
(often caused by Self-Abuse) is one of the most common causes of
these complaints. It was here that +Lallemand+ and +Civiale+ found
the key-note of the true treatment of these diseases.

5. VARICOCELE, or a wormy, swollen or twisted state of the veins in the
bag, and of those that run down to the testicles, is a very common cause
of both Spermatorrhoea, Impotency and Debility. (For full description of
this very common and often unexpected disease, send for our illustrated
pamphlet on the subject, or see Chapter XI, page 44 of this book.) No
man or boy with Varicocele, no matter how it was produced, can be
perfectly sound and strong in his Sexual Organs.

6. UNDEVELOPED, WASTED OR MISSHAPEN PARTS.--A failure to have perfectly
developed organs sometimes dates from birth, but in most cases it is
caused by self-abuse at a time when the person is growing. In any case,
Seminal weakness and Wasted or Misshapen Parts go together as both cause
and effect, and the one, when found, will usually very soon lead to the
other. _Twisting or Curving_ is one of the most positive signs of
previous inflammation, stricture and twisting or distortion of the
seminal ducts, and hence sterility or barrenness. In such especially are
the remarkable effects of the +Civiale Treatment+ the most noticeable.
We can say with positiveness, and prove it by case after case, that by
no other method can such rapid and perfect restoration of the organs to
a natural and healthy state be obtained as by this. Some of the very
worst and apparently most hopeless cases that we have had--cases that
have gone from one physician to another without the slightest
improvement--have yielded effectually to the +Civiale Remedies+. In some
of them the persons thus afflicted would have been totally unfitted for
marriage had they failed to find relief. Their children--healthy, happy
and finely developed--speak volumes for what our treatment has done for
them. (For Treatment refer to page +42+ of this book.)


IMPOTENT OLD MEN--
  THE SEXUAL DECAY OF ADVANCING AGE.

We have thus far given briefly the most common causes of Seminal
Disease. There are a few that we have not mentioned: Blows on the Head,
Loins (Small of the Back), Testicles, &c.; Weakness caused by prolonged
illness, fevers, &c.; Malaria, Consumption, &c.; the abuse of Tobacco,
Opium, Alcohol and Chloral, &c., &c.; but these are less common and less
important. There is one condition, however, that we have only referred
to incidentally, and that is the failure of Sexual Power in men past
middle age. No man (if he is reasonably careful and does not abuse
himself) should find his powers decaying before he is seventy or eighty
years of age. Mind, we do not say "no man does," but no man "_should_,"
provided he is reasonably careful.

But here comes the fact. Most men are _not_ careful, and most men _have_
abused themselves at some period. Many believe and stoutly maintain that
they "never had emissions or seminal disease, and it didn't hurt them."
But it did, and it is just now that they begin to feel it. It is true
they escaped the more acute and direful effects, but it told on them in
after years. There are many thousands to-day who are just now feeling
the effects of early vices, now almost forgotten. They can be restored
to _natural_ power by proper treatment, but they rarely are, because but
few of them believe that early self-abuse or later Onanism has anything
to do with it. So they spend a fortune almost--and uselessly too--on
Stimulants, Nervines, Tonic and the like, but still remain partly or
wholly Impotent. Foolish men!




_CHAPTER II._

THE VITAL FLUID

What it Is, What it Does, and How it is allowed to Drain Away,
Weakening, Emasculating and Dementing the Vicious and the Careless.
Diurnal (daily) Emissions. Nocturnal (nightly) Emissions. Impalpable
Oozings. Losses in the Urine. Losses while at Stool. Mistaken Gleet.


There are thousands of weak, nerveless men, who do not know what ails
them; thousands of invalids whose physicians are puzzled and perplexed
by their symptoms, and cannot account for the rapid waste of strength,
energy and vitality, much less check it; and thousands of others, on
the street, in the pulpit, on the bench, in the counting room, whose
troubles, illness and misery are due to losses of vital fluid. Some
know it, many more do not. Some are being properly or improperly treated
for it; many are being dosed and drugged for Malaria, Neurasthenia,
Consumption, Overwork, Brain Troubles, Paralysis and many equally as
foolish and irrational complaints. They sicken, die, destroy themselves
in hopeless despair of ever getting well and strong again, verge into
hopeless idiocy or go raving mad, simply because their trouble is not
understood; because day by day and hour by hour there is draining from
them in their urine, at stool and otherwise, that precious vital fluid
that represents life, health and energy to them.

  Each _lobule_ may be seen (carefully guarded from pressure or injury)
  in its cell, with a strong fibrous partition on each side. All these
  _lobules_ empty into small ducts which converging form the _Globus
  Major_, _Epididymis_ and _Globus Minor_, which finally end in the
  _Vas Deferens_, _Cord_, _Duct_, or _Tube_ that conveys the fluid to
  the Seminal Vesicles at the back of the bladder. (See _Figs._ 5, 6.)
  As the veins of a _Varicocele_ surround these delicate _lobules_
  as well as _fine tubing_, it can readily be seen how easily such
  pressure, weight and crowding may do very serious injury and make
  the flow of semen irregular, or shut it off altogether.}

And is it surprising that the continual losses do drain away strength
and vitality? This fluid is the only one charged with _life_--actual
_life_; capable of producing _life_--of creating offspring--of
impregnating and developing into perfect being, with thinking and
reasoning brain and mind, pulsating heart, expanding lungs, sentient
nerves, motive muscle, and all that beautiful, minute and co-ordinate
mechanism that forms a perfect human being--the only secretion in the
body capable of propagating species--carrying _life_ within _life_.

Surely this was not meant for waste. Surely the influence of its loss
upon the system, especially of a boy or young man (growing and not fully
developed), must be great, and it is. Many and many a young man thus
wastes away before the eyes of his friends from no other cause. Many a
one loses health and strength from this cause alone, yet does not know
it. How much better if all this false modesty, social hypocrisy, and
blundering medical dosing and drugging, without thorough examination and
full understanding, were wholly done away with, and the young men, and
old men too, were brought to understand two cardinal facts:

(a) The immense devitalizing effects of even small continued losses of
vital fluid, and,

(b) The fact that many apparently strong and healthy, as well as weak
and nerveless, men who find their sexual powers gradually or suddenly
failing them, can, in nine cases out of ten, trace it directly to
losses of vital fluid in the urine or otherwise, that have been going
on--perhaps wholly unknown to them--for months or years past.

(See also chapter on "Hidden Spermatorrhoea")


ANALYSIS OF URINE.

At the first symptom of Sexual Decay or Nervous Exhaustion, the person
thus affected should have his urine carefully and thoroughly analyzed by
some competent person. In saying "competent person," we speak advisedly,
for but few chemists and fewer physicians are competent to make such
an examination and draw correct deductions from what is to be found
there. Any person can, with the proper reagents, test his urine for
the presence or absence of semen, but he cannot make the thorough,
scientific, chemical and microscopical analysis that is sometimes needed
in order to arrive at a full and perfect diagnosis and successful
treatment.

If losses of semen are taking place in the urine, it would be well to
forward a sample of it at once, for a full and extended analysis, which
will be made for the nominal fee of $2, merely to cover the cost of
chemicals.

Our Chemical Laboratory is under the supervision of Mr. G. H. E. Du
Bell, Ph.D., a thoroughly competent quantitative and qualitative
analytical chemist, a graduate of the French and German Universities
and also a licentiate in this country, who, with his able corps of
assistants, makes all examinations and reports in full upon them to the
Medical Chief of Staff, who in turn submits them with the histories of
each to the full Consulting Board or Staff.




_CHAPTER III._

THE FORMS, SYMPTOMS AND CONSEQUENCES
Of Masturbation, Spermatorrhoea, Nervous Exhaustion
and Spinal Irritability.


In no disease known to us are the symptoms precisely the same in every
case. They vary with the constitutional peculiarities of the individual.
Yet in nearly every case there are certain prominent or leading symptoms
(signs) that are rarely absent at _some_ stage of the disease. We give
here the more noticeable ones at first laid down by +Lallemand+, the
great French physician, who first gave us the name "Spermatorrhoea,"
who first wrote upon this disease, who was the first to discover the
connection between the losses of semen and certain symptoms here given,
and who, too, was the great originator of that treatment so successfully
perfected by his successor, +Prof. Civiale+, and which is now the
_standard_ treatment, recognized and adopted in all the French
hospitals.


OBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS DUE TO MASTURBATION.

First, as to the appearance and actions of the +Masturbator+--he who is
constantly and recklessly drawing drafts of exhaustion and decay on the
nervous energy and strength of his coming manhood, and which are sure to
bankrupt the most robust health.

If there is a man to be pitied on this earth, it is he who is walking
about from day to day conscious of being guilty of ever having practiced
this vice. Mark the man who is addicted to it in no matter how light a
form; _his face tells the story of his sin_. See his +haggard looks+,
his +deep, sunken eyes+, which he throws only half-way into the
countenance of his friend. _Note the +blue+ or +black discolorations+
under the +eye+; the +nervousness+ to get away from a crowd, and the
extreme +girlishness+ or +backwardness+ when +introduced+ into the
+company of ladies+._

The victim of the most dangerous of all vices soon reaches a state
which, if not promptly relieved by the proper remedy, will end in
life-long misery or an early death.

Objectively considered, the masturbator is recognized by a marked facial
expression, by a characteristic mannerism, and by a peculiar mental
state.

THE FACE.--_The +facial expression+ consists of a +pale+ and +sallow
tint+ of the skin, unusual +development+ of +acne+,--red pimples,--
especially on the +forehead+; a +dark circle+ around the +orbits+;
+dilated+ and +sluggish pupils+; +lustreless eyes+, and an +oblique line
extending+ from the +inner angle+ of the +lids transversely+ across the
+cheek+ to the +lower margin+ of the +malar+ (cheek) +bone+. The +face+
has a +haggard, troubled, furtive expression+._

THE MANNER.--_The +manner+ of the +masturbator+ is peculiar. He is
+listless, shy, retiring+, and +easily confused+; he +avoids society+,
preferring +solitude+; there is a want of +steadiness+ and +decision+
in his +locomotion+; his inferior +extremities+ seem +deficient+ in
+power+, and all his movements betray +a mind ill at ease+._

THE MIND.--_His +mental operations+ are +confused+; his +speech is
embarrassed, awkward+, and +without directness+; his +memory+ is
+defective+, and he is +absent-minded+ and +given+ to +reverie+. If the
habit has long existed, and been excessively frequent in repetition,
+epilepsy+ may be produced; or +serious mental disorder+, as +delusional
insanity+, +dementia+, etc., may occur._

THE SEXUAL ORGANS.--The state of the +genital organs+ varies with the
length of time the habit has been indulged. In some young subjects,
there will be observed an _+extraordinary development+ of the +organ+_,
owing to premature excitement; but the disproportion is not maintained.
Prof. Barthalow says: "With the progress of the habit the organ becomes
_+small+ and +relaxed+, the +erections feeble+, the +corpora cavernosa+
either +waste away+ or their +vessels+ lose their +tonicity+, whereby
an apparent +shrinkage takes place+; the +corpus spongiosum+ and the
+glands+ also +shrink+, so that the +prepuce+ (fore-skin) appears
+unnaturally elongated+. The +testes+ may +increase+ in +size+, become
+tender+ and +irritable+_, or they may waste away to nothing but little
strings; the latter is the more usual result.

"_+Pains+ in the small of the +back+, a sense of +weight+ and +aching+
in the +loins+, around the +anus+, and in the +testes+_ is experienced.
_The +appetite is capricious+, the +digestion feeble, and the bowels+
are +constipated+_, or constipation alternates with diarrhoea.

"_The+ mind+ is +deficient+ in +power+ of +attention+, the +imagination
is constantly pervaded with vague erotic dreams+, the +moral sense+
is +blunted+, and the +perceptions+ are +dull+ and +confused+. +Pains+
in the +head+, in the +occipital+ and +frontal regions+ (front and back
of head)_, and a sense of fullness, and in serious cases _alarming
+Vertigo+ (dizziness and falling); +pains+ in the course of the
+principal nerves+, and an extreme +nervous susceptibility+, are
experienced. The +organic nervous system+_ manifests a functional
disturbance in harmony with the disorder of the nervous system of animal
life. _+Gastralgia+ and +abdominal pain+ (pain in stomach and bowels)_
and +uneasiness+ are in some cases very distressing symptoms.

"The distinctiveness of the foregoing symptoms will be determined
by the extent and duration of the habit, and by the constitutional
peculiarities of the patient. +The more highly developed the nervous
system, and the more it preponderates in activity over the muscular and
digestive systems, the more serious the effects.+


EFFECTS OF MASTURBATION ON THE MIND

"The most serious +mental effects+ are produced by +masturbation+. This
vice, commenced at or before the period of puberty, interferes seriously
with the development of the brain and the evolution of the mental
faculties.

"That +spermatorrhoea+ will produce in one class of cases
+mental disorders+, and not in another, indicates either that some
predisposition to these disorders existed, or that the habit of
+self-pollution+ was merely an expression of +mental alienation+
(insanity). The +images+ which pervade the minds of boys possessed
of the highly-developed nervous organization of masturbators are those
of +delusional insanity+.

"There is, however, a +cerebral+ (brain) +phase+ of spermatorrhoea which
may be separated from the two preceding classes. It is characterized by
_+indistinctness of vision+, +dilatation+ of the +pupil+, +amblyopia+
(near-sightedness), +diplopia+ (double sight); +diminution+ in the
+sensitiveness+ of the +auditory apparatus+ (deafness); +feebleness+
of +voice+; +mental preoccupation+, +hebetude+ of +mind+, +confusion+
of +ideas+, and a +profound melancholy+._

"The termination of such cases is in _+suicidal monomania+, +delusional
insanity+, etc._ In that variety of the cerebral form in which a
decided predisposition must be admitted to exist, to disorder of the
intellectual faculties, there are found various forms of mental
alienation. The +chronic form+ is the most common, which corresponds
to the _+melancholia+ of +Pinel+, or the +lypemania+ of +Esquirol+,
terminating in +dementia+._ Several of the most characteristic cases
which have happened under my observation correspond to the _+delusional
insanity+ of +Bucknill and Tuke+_."--[Manual of Psychological Medicine,
Phila. ed., p. 103.]


INSANITY FROM SPERMATORRHOEA.

Many writers are disposed to underrate the importance of this tendency
in spermatorrhoea. The statistics of any of our large insane asylums
will illustrate the influence of masturbation in the production of
insanity. Mr. Holmes Coote, in a discussion which followed Dr.
Drysdale's paper on the "Medical Aspects of Prostitution," read before
the Harveian Society of London, remarked that "he still entertained the
opinion that there were no worse evils appertaining to human weakness
than this. He had opportunities of witnessing the fact that among the
young there was no cause of insanity more common than indulging in
habits which he would not further particularize, but which were known to
result in the most complete bodily and mental prostration."--[British
Medical Journal, Feb. 17, 1866.]

Dr. John P. Gray, the distinguished Superintendent of the State Asylum
at Utica, New York (Twenty-Fourth Annual Report, 1867), thus speaks of
the +influence of masturbation+ in the production of +insanity+: "The
records of this institution show five hundred and twenty-one cases
admitted directly attributable to this vice, and I am well convinced
