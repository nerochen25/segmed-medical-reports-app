As the primary coil and core may be considered as an electro magnet,
it may not be out of place to notice the rule governing such.
Magnetization of an iron core is mainly dependent upon the ampere turns
of the coil surrounding it—that is, one ampere carried around the core
for one hundred turns (100 ampere-turns) would equal in effect ten
amperes flowing through ten turns. Practically speaking, there would
be certain variations to the rule, for one difficulty would arise in
that the smaller wire used in conveying the smaller current would fit
more compactly and allow more turns to be nearer the core, the active
effect of the turns always decreasing with their distance from the
core. And although a large current and few turns would not have so much
self-induction, there would be trouble at the contact breaker, owing
to the large current it would have to control.

The most suitable sizes of wire for the primary coil are: No. 16 B.
& S. for coils up to 1 inch spark; No. 14 B. & S. up to 4 inches of
spark, and No. 12 B. & S. for a 6-inch spark coil. The coil should be,
say, one-twelfth of the core length shorter than the core.

_I_ is the insulating tube between the primary coil and the secondary
coil _S_. Here great precaution is necessary to prevent any liability
of short circuiting or breaking through of sparks from the secondary
coil. This danger cannot be underestimated, and the tube should be
either of glass or hard rubber, free from flaws, varying in thickness
with the dimensions of the coil. It should extend at least one-tenth
of the total length of the primary coil beyond it at each end. The end
of this tube can be turned down so as to allow of the hard rubber reel
ends being slipped on and held in position by outside hard rubber
rings (Fig. 2).

 [Illustration: FIG. 2.]

The secondary coil consists of many turns of fine insulated copper wire
separated from the primary coil by the insulating tube and a liberal
amount of insulating compound at each end. In coils giving under 1 inch
of spark this coil may be wound in two or more sections.

 [Illustration: FIG. 3.]

The usual manner of constructing these sections is to divide up the
space on the insulating tube by means of hard rubber rings placed at
equal distances apart, in number according to the number of sections
desired (Fig. 3). The space between each set of rings, or between
the coil end and a ring, is wound with the wire selected, the filled
sections constituting a number of complete coils, which are finally
connected in series. The sectional method of winding prevents the
liability of the spark jumping through a short circuit, but heightens
its tendency to pass into the primary coil at the ends, where it must
be therefore specially insulated from it.

 [Illustration: FIG. 4.]

In winding these sections there is a method now generally adopted which
has many good points, although at first it may seem complicated. The
old way of filling two sections was to wind both in the same direction
as full as desired, then join the outside end of the left-hand coil
to the inside end of the right-hand coil. This necessitated bringing
the outside end down between two disks, or in a vertical hole in the
sectional divider, and thereby rendered it liable to spark through into
its own coil. This is shown in Fig. 4, _A_ and _C_ inside ends, _B_ and
_D_ outside ends, the disk being between _B_ and _C_.

 [Illustration: FIG. 5.]

Reference to Fig. 3 shows the new method, and Fig. 5 shows an enlarged
diagram of sections 2 and 3 of Fig. 3.

Sections 1 and 3, Fig. 3, are filled with as many turns as desired; the
spool is then turned end for end, and sections 2 and 4 are wound, being
thus in the opposite direction of winding to sections 1 and 3.

The inside ends of 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 are soldered together, and the
outside ends of 2 and 3 are also soldered together.

The outside ends of 1 and 4 serve as terminals for the coil.

This method of connection leaves all the turns so joined that the
current circulates in the same direction through them all, as will be
seen by an examination of the enlarged diagram, Fig. 5.

Sprague, in his "Electricity: Its Theory, Sources, and Application,"
recommends that the turns of wire in the secondary coil shall gradually
increase in number until the middle of the spool is reached, and then
decrease to the spool end, in order that the greatest number of turns
be in the strongest part of the magnetic field (see Fig. 6). _D D D_
are section dividers, _S_ secondary windings, _P_ primary coil. The
selection of the size of wire to be used depends on the requirements as
to the spark. If a short thick spark be desired, use a thick wire, say
No. 34 B. & S.; if a long thin one, use No. 36 to No. 40 B. & S.

 [Illustration: FIG. 6.]

Although it is impossible to lay down rules for determining the exact
amount of wire to be used to obtain a certain sized spark, yet a fair
average is to allow 1¼ pounds No. 36 B. & S. per inch spark for small
coils and slightly less for large ones.

The most satisfactory and perhaps the easiest way for large coils is to
wind the secondary in separate coils, made in a manner similar to that
employed in winding coils for the Thompson reflecting galvanometer.
This method, first described by Mr. F. C. Alsop in his treatise on
"Induction Coils," is somewhat as follows:

A special piece of apparatus (Figs. 7 and 8) is necessary, but presents
no great difficulty in manufacture. A metal disk, _D_, one-sixth of
an inch thick and 7 inches in diameter, is mounted on the shaft _S_.
A second disk is provided with a collar and set screw, _A_, in order
that it may be adjusted on the shaft at any desired distance from the
stationary one. When the diameter of the coil to be wound has been
decided upon, a wooden collar, _W_, with a bevelled surface is slipped
on the shaft, it corresponding in diameter with the desired diameter of
the hole through the centre of the secondary coil. As these coils are
going to be made as flat rings and slipped on over the insulating tube,
a remark here becomes necessary on this diameter. Reference to Fig. 9
will show that it is intended that the coils near the reel ends shall
fit very loosely on the tube _T_ (Fig. 1)—in fact, that there shall be
a clearance of possibly one-half inch in the extreme end, diminishing
gradually to a fifteenth of an inch in the centre coils. Therefore it
becomes necessary to provide a number of wooden rings equal to the
desired diameter of the central hole in the coil. The thickness of
the wood determining the width of the individual coil depends on the
selection of the operator; but the rule may be laid down that the
narrower the coils the better the insulation of the complete coil will
be on completion.

 [Illustration: FIG. 9.]

One-sixteenth of an inch is a very fair average, and has been generally
adopted by the writer.

A quantity of paper rings are now cut out of stout writing paper which
has been soaked in melted paraffin. If a block or pad of letter paper
be soaked in paraffin and allowed to become cold under pressure, the
ring may be scratched on the surface of it and the block cut through on
a jig saw. The central apertures of course will vary in size with their
position on the tube _T_ (Fig. 9).

The coil winder is now either mounted in a lathe or fixed in a hand
magnet winder in such manner that it can be steadily and rapidly
rotated. The wire to be wound comes on spools, which can be so
threaded on a piece of metal rod that they turn readily. A metal dish
containing melted paraffin is provided with a round rod, preferably of
glass, fixed under the paraffin surface, so that it can rotate freely
when the wire passes under it through the paraffin. Two paper rings are
slipped on the winder that they may form, as it were, reel ends for the
coil, and if the metal disks have been warmed it is an easy matter to
lay them flat.

The end of the wire is then passed through the paraffin under the
glass rod and through the hole _H_ in the metal disk for a distance
of, say, 6 inches, and held to the disk outside with a dab of paraffin
or beeswax. Then the winder is rotated and the space between the paper
disks is filled with wire. The paraffin, being hot, will adhere to the
wire, and cooling as the wire lays down on the winder, hold the turns
together and at the same time insulate them from each other. It will
not be possible to lay the wire in even layers, as would be necessary
in winding a wider coil, but the spaces can be filled up, using
ordinary care that no radical irregularity occurs—that is, that only
adjacent layers are likely to commingle.

When the space is filled up to the level of the paper disks and the
paraffin is hard, loosen the set screw, and removing the outside disk,
the coil can be slipped off, or a slight warming will loosen it. Any
number of these coils can be made, and there are the advantages in
this mode of construction that a bad coil will not spoil the whole
secondary, and that the wire can be obtained in comparatively small
quantities.

As each coil will not be of very high resistance, the continuity of
the wire can be readily tested by means of a few cells of battery,
connecting one end of the coil to one pole of the battery, and the
other pole of the battery and coil end touched to the tongue. If a
burning sensation is experienced, the connection is not broken. Where
possible the coils should be measured as to their resistance on a
Wheatstone bridge.

When the requisite number of coils has been prepared, they are
assembled in the following manner (Fig. 9): The coils, having their
aperture diameter graded, are placed in order, and starting with the
one having the largest hole, it is slipped over the primary protection
tube _T_, one end being brought out through a hole in the reel end
drilled vertically or between the reel end and the coil. A couple of
paper rings are then slipped on the tube, and another coil placed over
them, having its ends connected as in Fig. 3. This process is continued
until all the coils are in place. The annular space between the coils
and the tube _T_ (Fig. 9) is filled in with melted paraffin and the
coils gently pressed together, so as to form a compact mass, paraffin
being poured over the outside of the whole combination. Before winding
any wire used in this work it must be perfectly dry, which end can be
accomplished by subjecting the whole spool to a short period of baking
in a moderately warm oven.

The accompanying table gives the length of No. 36 silk-covered wire
that will fill a linear space equal to one thickness of the wire in
different-sized rings. This size wire wound tight will give 125 turns
per linear inch. Therefore on a ring having a middle aperture of 1½
inches and an outside diameter of 4 inches, there will be 156 turns, or
a total length of 1347 inches. This is obtained as follows: 1½ inches
× 3.1416 = 4.7124 (or 4.712); 4 inches × 3.1416 = 12.5664 (or 12.56);
(4.712 + 12.56)∕2 = mean circumference—viz., 8.635 inches.

This mean × number of turns in thickness of ring between the two
circumferences—viz., 156 = 1347 inches.

To obtain the length of wire necessary for a ring occupying more than
the space of one turn on the primary insulating tube, multiply the
length before obtained by the number of turns in the space it occupies.
Thus a flat ring one-tenth of an inch thick would equal 1347 inches ×
12.5.

This rule is necessarily only approximate, owing to the way the wires
bed on each other from their cylindrical section. In actual practice,
when the wire is run through the paraffin bath not more than 50 per
cent of the calculated wire will occupy the space. And the thickness of
the paper rings must also be added when figuring the total length of
the coil. In the iron-clad transformers or induction coils of highest
efficiency used in the alternating current electric light system, the
rule for determining the windings of the coils is based on the ratio
of the turns of wire in the primary to the turns in the secondary, the
electromotive force in the primary, and the lines of force cut by the
windings.

The secondary ends can be attached to binding posts mounted on the reel
ends. Unless these reel ends be very high and clear the outside of the
coil considerably, it is better to mount the binding posts on the top
of the hard rubber pillars. A neat plan is to mount on the top of the
coil a hard rubber plate reaching from reel end to reel end, and place
the binding posts on that.

A discharger consists of two sliding metal rods with insulated handles
passing through pillars attached to the secondary coil. The inside ends
of these rods is provided with screw threads for the ready attachment
of the balls, points, etc., which are to be used. The substance to be
acted upon is laid on a rubber or glass table midway between the rod
pillars and slightly below the level of the rods.

By hinging the rod pillars, or using a ball and socket joint, the
discharger can be inclined so as to be better brought near the
substance on the table.

The next important part of the coil is the contact breaker.

The armature _R_ is a piece of soft iron carried at the end of a stiff
spring, in about the middle of which, at _B_, is riveted a small
platinum disk or stud. The adjusting screw _A_ has its point also
furnished with a piece of platinum, which is intended to touch the
platinum on the spring when the latter is in its normal position. The
core _C_ of the coil serves as an electro-magnet. When the current
flows from the battery (represented by the figure at _L_) through the
primary coil and armature spring to the adjusting screw, it causes the
armature to be drawn to the magnetized core, but thereby draws the
platinum disk away from the adjusting screw. In so doing it breaks the
circuit, the magnet loses its power, and the elasticity of the spring
reasserting itself, carries the armature back, thereby reclosing the
circuit. This is repeated many times in a second, the result being a
continual vibration of the spring, and a consequent interruption to the
current.

The condenser or Leyden jar _J_, connected as in the diagram to the
base of the vibrating spring at _K_ and to the adjusting screw wire
_M_, is constructed as follows: On a sheet of insulated paper is laid
a smaller sheet of tinfoil, one edge of which projects an inch or so
over one end of the paper. Another sheet of paper covering this carries
a second sheet of tinfoil, one end of which projects as in the first
sheet, but at the opposite end of the paper. Tinfoil and paper sheets
are laid in this manner alternately until a sufficient number is
attained. The projecting ends are then clamped together and the whole
pile immersed in melted paraffin, as will be described in a subsequent
chapter. Wires are affixed to these clamped ends which serve to connect
the condenser with the contact breaker. The conventional sign for a
condenser is that used at _J_, showing the two series of plates, the
insulation or dielectric, as it is called, being understood.

The size of condenser to use with different-sized coils varies
according to the winding of the primary and the battery used. A primary
coil of few turns would not necessitate as large a condenser as one of
a large number of turns. At the same time, a condenser may be made of
too great a capacity, and thereby weaken the action of the coil.

The base upon which the coil and its parts are mounted may be of dried
polished wood. But where the coil is designed to give large sparks—over
2 inches—it is an advantage to use hard rubber one quarter of an inch
and upward in thickness. Glass, were it not for the difficulty of
drilling it and its brittleness, would be a desirable material for a
coil base in a dry atmosphere. Hard red or black fibre coated with
shellac varnish is also serviceable, and, moreover, is extremely easy
to work. Slate must never be used; there is too much liability of
iron veins being found in it, which in such high tension experiments
as will be described would seriously impair the usefulness of the
apparatus. The material selected for the base must be one that will
not absorb moisture. A paraffined surface collects moisture up to a
certain point in isolated drops, whereas a glass and even a hard rubber
surface condenses the moisture as a film, which latter is extremely
undesirable. But unfortunately the fact that a paraffined surface
does not present a pleasing appearance would probably result in its
rejection. And lastly, by mounting the coil on hard rubber blocks, or
extending the reel ends to raise the coil body, a high insulation can
be obtained at the sacrifice perhaps of appearance or height. From
the care taken to insulate the secondary coil, it may be considered a
superfluous precaution to so carefully select a base, but practical
work with the instrument at some important crisis will demonstrate
the necessity of extreme care in the smallest details relating to
insulation. It may be well to note here that hard rubber is acted upon
by ozone, and is thereby impaired as an insulator.
